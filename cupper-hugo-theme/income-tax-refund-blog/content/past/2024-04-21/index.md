i.t.r. presents

**Strzał w kolano** (classical guitar knee shot / Wrocław)

We're stoked to have two acts from our much venerated music collective Salka coming to town once more. That's the collective that already garlanded our shows with mind-expanding artists like the _Kurws_, the _Przepych_, the _Atol Atol Atol_ or the _Barłóg_. This time our inner worlds will be perfused by Jakub Majchrzak (whom you know from the aforementioned _Kurws_ or from _Życia Żółć_) and his befuddlingly ill-tempered guitar musings under the _Strzał w kolano_ moniker. With string sounds and shreds that sit right where you not expect them to be and organized disorganization in the musical structures, here's some campfire music to turn your brain all marshmallow-y.

**Zdrój** (noise punk improv / Fonoradar Records + Syf Records / Wrocław)

..and secondly, we've got _Zdrój_ coming back with some noise punk miniatures, not to say: fast, pronged and taut guitar and drum interminglings for the era of short attention spans.

**Ari Raketo & Piet** (experimental synth pop / Patching Flowers. / Leipzig)

Surprise! This town still has got some artists in it, you haven't seen or heard of yet, unless you been digging really deep and hit upon this sparkling spring of sweet and ingenuous pop tunes as served by this duo here: Ari Raketo & Piet sing about love, pizza, public transport and going for the stars until your heart yearns.

**Clara Fall** (sonic research duo / Leipzig)

When _Clara Fall_ became absorbed into the world of pulsating machines, they were greeted by a committee of unbodily sounds, crackles, sizzles and wobbles.
