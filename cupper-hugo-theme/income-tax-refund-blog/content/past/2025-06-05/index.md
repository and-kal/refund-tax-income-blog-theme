**OMNI SELASSI** [CH/LE]

genre-defying trio formed in 2019. Since then, the band (Rea (vocals, guitar, synth), Mirko (drums, electroharp) and Lukas (drums, synth)) has been relentlessly active across stages throughout Europe and beyond. Their sound is unpredictable and ever-shifting: part pop, part punk, part ritual, always experimental. Two drummers, a voice, a guitar, and a collection of sonic oddities collide to something strange and beautiful.

**SENSOR GHOST** [US]

no-wave art-punk trio from Washington, DC. Former/current projects include Puff Pieces, Antelope, Weed Tree, Light Beams, Vertebrates, and Stigmatics. The band’s first LP, “Irritation on Demand,” was recorded with Ian MacKaye and Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studios.

**ALMOND BUTYL** [FR]

=surreal sonic alias of Armand Bultheel (also known from Agar Agar). Electronic experimentation meets whimsical emotional landscapes. With their latest release, Natural Idol, Almond Butyl crafts a vibrant and uncanny world—a synthetic garden humming with life, contradiction, and offbeat charm.
The music lives somewhere between electro, ambient, and playful IDM, often built around analog synth loops, processed vocals, and fragmented melodies that feel both hand-crafted and algorithmically misbehaving.
