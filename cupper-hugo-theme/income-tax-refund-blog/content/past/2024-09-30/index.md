**Krachim**

{AI inspired pop | LPZ}

The brand new project Krachim is based in Leipzig, Germany and part of Hitness Club art collective. It's such a fresh layed egg that no one ever heard anything of it before. Be the first to discover the one-man band that is combining experimental pop, symphony, rock and electronic elements played with midi guitar.
