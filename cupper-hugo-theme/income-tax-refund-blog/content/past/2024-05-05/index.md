**Attic Ted** [San Marcos, Texas USA]

Grady's back in Leipzig and we're happy to co-release his new album with U-Bac.
Attic Ted is an interactive musical performance artist, playing weirdo gothic carnival musical theater, creepy and funny, utilizing cardboard constructed masks, to create a visual experience compounding the quirky bizarro pop music into a surrealist dream.

**Rea** [Bienne, CH]

...of Omni Selassi. Drone/Folk/Ambient and Poetry.
