**Sébastien Branche** (solo sax + computer magic)

„Ligne de crête„ (French: crest line) is Paris-raised and Leipzig-based Sébastien Branche’s electroacoustic saxophone solo. Borrowing from noise, drone, bruitism or EAI, Sébastien builds up architectures of sounds, extending the saxophone with a collection of objects to enhance or alter its sonic possibilities. Using the computer, he also sends sinewaves and noises into the body of the saxophone which processes and filters them acoustically, as well as outside the saxophone which modulates them electronically, for an intimate and immersive experience of sound.

**TraumaZone** (glitch A/V performance)

TraumaZone is a duo of a media and a sound artist based between Berlin and Leipzig. In their upcoming performance will perform with custom environments built with [PureData](http://puredata.info/) and [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/).

„The goal of our collective is to encourage contemplation on the impact design and communication have on the society, urging to reflect on the shared responsibility of creating spaces that accommodate all individuals, regardless of their physical or cultural attributes. We examine social interactions within public spaces through the ideas of a maze as a communication tool and a human body as a socio-political medium.„
