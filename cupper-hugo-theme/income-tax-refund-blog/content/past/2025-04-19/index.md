**The New Solarism** [Le]

exp. neo classic

"melt away listening to the dreamy music of The New Solarism – solo endeavour of Leipzig – based Izabela Kałduńska. Trained in classical music she does quite a good job using her skill for other, less academic stuff, like creating ambient noise/soundscapes with violin, loops, effects and samples. Simple as it sounds, the layers resonate in complex ways." (Pracht, 2019)

exp. guitar research

"After a decade of performing concerts under the Mariachi guise, Nina Garcia has finally unveiled her unique approach in ‘Bye Bye Bird‘, her first album under her name, released by Ideologic Organ.
