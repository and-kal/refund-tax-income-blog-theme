ITR + Annoyed By Death + OMNI present:

**Luna Vega** (Leipzig)

Luna Vega’s first studio efforts involved just a preset drum machine + Vermona organ, often nodding to 70s proto-electronic pioneers. The project has now evolved into a 3piece live band: repetitive drum machine patterns, multi-layered organs, wonky synths, 90's psych guitars. Spaced-out nostalgia-powered grooves for the heads of the 2020's.

**Neuköllner Speed Dating Club** (Leipzig)

...started as a solo project based around samplers, drum machines, synthesizers and keyboards, but now performs with a constantly changing line-up of various instruments. The drones, kraut-like repetition and bouncy electronic drums mixed with motorik sampled kits creates a hypnotic and psychedelic feel, mixed with a pinch of things like dub, noise and pop.

**Sentuhlà** (ritualistic riddims / Valencia / Abstrakce Records)

»Sentuhlà is one of the many aliases of musical jack of all trades José Guerrero, a long standing figure in the already rich underground scene of Valencia. In this solo excursion he explores the vast possibilities of mechanical repetition, the machine funk of dirtbag rhythms and proper boogie DIY synth music, sculpting a syncopated sound that is both modern and atavistic. Coming from a deep knowledge and ability to communicate very diverse sounds, slow jams unfold into dance music for clear eyed lounge lizards for whom sleaze comes not dizzy but focused. Whitened african rhythms beat up no wave disco pleasure points, managing the hard task of being very cool and nonchalant, but also hot and dedicated.«
