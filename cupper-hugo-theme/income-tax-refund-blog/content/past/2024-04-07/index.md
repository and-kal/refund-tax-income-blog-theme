**Sébastien Branche** (neuschönefeld)

„Ligne de crête“ (Crest line in French) is Paris-raised and Leipzig-based Sébastien Branche’s electroacoustic saxophone solo. Borrowing from noise, drone, bruitism or EAI, Sébastien builds up architectures of sounds, extending the saxophone with a collection of objects to enhance or alter its sonic possibilities. Using the computer, he also sends sinewaves and noises into the body of the saxophone which processes and filters them acoustically, as well as outside the saxophone which modulates them electronically, for an intimate and immersive experience of sound.
