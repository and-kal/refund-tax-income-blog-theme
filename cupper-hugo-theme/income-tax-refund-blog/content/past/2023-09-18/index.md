All the herbs have been smoked. Datashock deliver a new album: "Geltungsbereich Universum". Their second for Bureau B and the eighth in a career as an internationally active collective of musicians which has spanned two decades (so far). Space is the place.


**Pretty Lightning** (desertblues / saaaaaarrrrland)

Pretty Lightning 3.0 is the PL duo morphing into a trio to perform a fully instrumental set referring to their latest album „Dust Moves“ (2022, Fuzz Club). Conjuring images that are earthbound and cosmic in equal measure on a cinematic journey through meandering desert blues, strung-out psych-rock and widescreen, hypnotic drones.


**Javier Areal Velez** (experimentalelectroacoustics / aaaaarrrrrgentina)

⁂ [javierarealvelez.bandcamp.com](https://javierarealvelez.bandcamp.com)

Composer and improviser, who performs mostly on electric guitar, with or without objects stuffed between its strings. His musical approach relies heavily on a primal technique that emphasizes timbre and rhythm, avoiding traditional forms in favor of intensity and dynamic contrast.
