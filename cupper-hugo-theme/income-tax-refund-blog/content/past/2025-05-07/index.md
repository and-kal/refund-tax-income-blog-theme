**Giulio Erasmus & Ex-Worm 3000** [brussels / manchester]

Giulio Erasmus (of the funky formations Handle and D.U.D.S.) is back with the band: Ex-Worm 3000 or The End of the Worm or The Worm Parade or Paradigm or whatever they're called this time around. Once again, bringing a fine, dub-infused blend of James Chance-esque no-wave punk and a soulfulness inherited from classics like The Specials with plenty of delay slapped on the synths, percussion jinglings all over, lovely harmonies and enchaining bass lines.

**VMO aka. Violent Magic Orchestra** [japan]

VMO are ダークスローン (Darkthrone), メイヘム (Mayhem), エンペラー (Emperor), ザスター (Zastar) and ゴルゴロス (Gorgoroth) and the music is like mixing all these bands they named themselves after together with some Skrillex, Prodigy and Venetian Snares. A purgatorial mix of gabber, noise pop, black metal and visual kei. Appropriately enough, they have been working together with a flabbergasting list of people so diverse, you've never seen them in one and the same sentence before: Vampilia, Attila Csihar, Chip King (The Body), SUNNO)), Kælan Mikla, Pete Swanson (Yellow Swans), Dylan Walker (full of hell), Gabber Modus Operandi, and (last but not least) Japanese VJ artist [Kezzardrix](https://kezzardrix.net/) doing off-the-hook visuals and videos for the band. Be prepared to get sucked into a hellish vortex of rave energy, blinding strobe lights and next-level visuals.

VMO's first album "Catastrophic Anonymous" was released on world's end girlfriend’s label Virgin Babylon Records and Throatruiner Records, followed by DEATH RAVE (out on Never Sleep) and their current tour "RAINBOW FROM ANGEL CORPSE", which is...

> ...the latest version of DEATH RAVE, in which the boundaries between body and brain, reality and fantasy, as presented by VMO, disappear and merge. Devil's numbers and Xenakis' mathematics. The whereabouts of angelic corpses. Rainbow-colored despair. People dance and frolic in dreams of extreme colors and monochromes. It is the beginning of a hopeful apocalypse as the brain reaches the end of consciousnessand the body returns to the heavens.
