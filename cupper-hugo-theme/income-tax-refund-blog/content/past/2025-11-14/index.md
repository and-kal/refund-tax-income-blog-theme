[WOMBO](https://www.wombo.band/) [exp. post-punk / KY, USA]

W. inventively fuse indie rock with post-punk and art rock. Their music is atmospheric and angular, featuring hypnotic vocals over bass-driven melodies and sharp, abstract guitar work. The band's sound is often described as organized chaos, creating engaging and otherworldly soundscapes.

[ZHED](https://zhed.weebly.com/) [sonic-punk / CH]

Zhed is a one‑person noise/post‑punk project that channels raw energy into every track. His sound juxtaposes abrasive textures with haunting melodies, creating an immersive, challenging sonic world. The music feels unpolished in the best way, as if every distortion, feedback squeal, and vocal crack is part of an intentional, visceral narrative.
