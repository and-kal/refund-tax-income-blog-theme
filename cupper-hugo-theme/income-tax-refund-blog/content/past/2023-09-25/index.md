**Vomitatrix** (space noise grind/NY,USA)

...are Gyna Bootleg (vocals), Rick eye (guitar), Tim Dahl (bass guitar, vocals), Weasel Walter (drums). The band conjures up something you might call ACID-GRIND. It’s vaguely based on traditional hardcore/grindcore archetypes, but the result is explosive hallucinatory madness, uniquely alchemical to the four personalities which make up the band. The “songs” are inexplicable structures that take perhaps one tiny grain from the idiom and flesh them out into a vortex of bizarre energy and noise. It’s structured, but anything can and does happen. As of now they made one very well received demo, with a full record slated to be released in August 2023.
