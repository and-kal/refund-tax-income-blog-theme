**Heavenphetamine** (Georgia/Ukraine)

Heavenphetamine is a Japanese krautrock/postpunk duo composed of Hiroki (keyboard/vocals) and Sara (drums/vocals), sometimes supported by flautist Kira Krempova. Described as a blend of Krautrock and Post-Punk, their musicality strongly reflects the influence of Western indie music. Simultaneously, the underlying Japanese melodies, beats, and Japanese lyrics contribute to crafting an exceptionally exotic sonic landscape.

**Neuköllner Speed Dating Club** (Leipzig)

NSDC started as a solo project based around samplers, drum machines, synthesizers and keyboards, but now performs with a constantly changing line-up of various instruments. The drones, kraut-like repetition and bouncy electronic drums mixed with motorik sampled kits creates a hypnotic and psychedelic feel, mixed with a pinch of things like dub, noise and pop.

**Luna Vega** (Leipzig)

Luna Vega’s first studio efforts involved just a preset drum machine accompanied by an old Vermona organ, often nodding to the 70s proto-electronic pioneers. Since then, the project has evolved into a three-piece live band driven by repetitive drum machine patterns, multi-layered organs, wonky syntheziers, and 90's psychedelic revival guitars. Spaced-out nostalgia-powered grooves for the heads of the 2020's.
