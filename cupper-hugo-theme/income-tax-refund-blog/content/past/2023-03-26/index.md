**ONYON** [wavy punk]

This local quartet volleys hits and hits and hits on end! So, get a good dose of ant-like rhythms, whippy guitars, with an icing of synthscapes and some bel cantos on top. (Top-seeded now on Trouble In Mind Records, Flennen and U-Bac, hehe.)

**KEVIN DIESEL** [spitzbubitapetechno]
…aka Flo of PartoutPartout – back in town after aeons - will likely launch some banging musical rockets to the rythm of the machines. This's gonna go so hard!

**CESAR PALACE** [human drum buddy]
…a percussive solo of tribal noisy technorave: this mashup of minimalism, cosmic drone and pure rhythm will melt any brain with his wide range of effects pedals, amplified kicks and shells, and all that drumming goodness.

**DOC FLIPPERS** [do the don'ts]
…is some deeply existential neo-folk project from Saxony, if I recall correctly. Or was it like the _Minutemen_ teaming up with the _Uranium Club_ for a round of opiates and Kentucky Bourbons (•ิ\_•ิ)? - Which one was it?
