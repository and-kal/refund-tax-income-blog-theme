**HALF DARLING** (AT)

alt. weirdo pop rock frm Vienna, Austria

Half Darling is a Vienna‑based alt‑weirdo pop‑rock collective that fuses punk, noise, hip‑hop and minimalist loops into catchy yet disrupting three‑minute rockets. Their self‑titled debut (June 2023) bursts with riot‑grrrl energy, feminist grit, and danceable hooks. Originally Gregor Mahnert’s solo loop project, Half Darling grew into a full band featuring Lisa Kortschak (vox), Elise Mory (synth), Oliver Stotz (bass/synth), Johanna Forster (guitar) and Werner Thenmayer (drums).
