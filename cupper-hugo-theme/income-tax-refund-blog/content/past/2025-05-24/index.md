**DuChamp** [brln]

Federica Rossella of SuperCheri and Pieuvre and also running Berlin's [Kitchen Leg Records](https://kitchenlegrecordsberlin.bandcamp.com) is on tour with her solo project DuChamp, once more draping us in sonic surroundings of accordion drones, guitar rackets and according pedal feedback loops.

> DuChamp is an Italian scientist, musician and curator based in Berlin, religiously devoted to drone. Drone is related to a precise childhood memory: the sound of the hair dryer, that her mother used to fix her hair. That was the sound of care, bliss, and infinite love. [...] DuChamp started to incorporate real field recordings, related to her personal memory, into her drone compositions, by adding layers of sounds and noise in attempt to recreate some kind of apophonias. Her debut album "NAR" has been released in 2013 through the italian cult label Boring Machines. In 2015 the split "Sculpture" with French sound artist Felicia Atkinson was released through Idiosyncratics. In 2016 and 2017 Full Body Massage records released that tapes "Nectere" and the following year "A Blazing World". Her new album "The Wild Joy" will be released in 2025 by Torto Edition, Ramble Records and Atena Records.

...and another smooth noisician from Berlin: Felix-Florian Tödtloff (fka. _Sferics_ and member of [Swoosh](https://soowsh.bandcamp.com), Magazine Magazine and The Old Dream of Symmetry) is in town again, with scratching, billowing sound walls and some sweeter synth arpeggiations, too.
