**Lemongrab** (Cnd/Brln)

Since their relocation from Toronto to Berlin in 2019 Lemongrab formed a new configuration which has made a quick yet lasting impression in the Berlin and wider European punk scene. Renowned for their raw and cathartic live shows and heavy but playful songwriting.

**Doc FLippers** (Lpz)

modern space cowboys who take us in a rocket with punky, psychedelic country music to the other side of the galaxy to drop us into a black hole. From the world they left behind, their riffs bring good news about the impending apocalypse to the new world while the singer runs out of oxygen.

**Neon Lies** (Zgrb)

Yo, it's our Croatian homeboy Neon Lies coming to town again and again to bring us some of his new noisy darkwave jams. You can dance, you can jiveâ€”or you can sit down and be gloomy. It's all appropriate.
