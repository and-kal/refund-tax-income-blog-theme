**Schade** [new wave disco psych] (CH)

The duo Schade came into existence in 2013 as a result of the collaboration between two active figures in the Swiss alternative music scene, Brynjar Thorsson (Welington Irish Black Warrior, Cochon Double) and Dany Digler (Dee Diglers, Los Orioles, Love Cans, TrashMantra). The band's universe is a skillful blend of their diverse influences, giving rise to hybrid music. Schade falls into a music style often defined as French chanson rooted in post-punk and new wave with a touch of psychedelia.

**Rouge Gorge** [odd synth pop] (F)

Carried by the fragile branches of two or three synthesizers, Robin Poligné with his big glasses, tight shirt and pants of a first-grader teleported from the 1980s, the just-thirty-year-old from Vitré (Ille-et-Vilaine) intrigued at first by his ritornellos with an outdated drum machine and keyboards as marked as his wardrobe. Then touched by heady themes and a seriously melancholy voice contrasting with pop hops, we rallied to the small triumph given him by an audience mostly unaware of the context of this singular profundity.
