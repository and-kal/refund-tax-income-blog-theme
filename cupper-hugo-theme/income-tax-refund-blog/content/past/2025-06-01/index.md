**TBA TBC** [Brln]

**Citron Citron** [CH]

[Citron Citron](https://linktr.ee/citroncitron) are a brother&sister pop synthétriste duo based in Geneva, CH. Augustin & Zoé play a mix of transcendental pop that offers synthetic soundscapes where voices, violins, synthesizers, guitars and punchy drum machines merge to create an infinite echo.

_Spontaneously hijacking this show:_

**OMNI SELASSI** [CH/LE]

genre-defying trio formed in 2019. Since then, the band (Rea (vocals, guitar, synth), Mirko (drums, electroharp) and Lukas (drums, synth)) has been relentlessly active across stages throughout Europe and beyond. Their sound is unpredictable and ever-shifting: part pop, part punk, part ritual, always experimental. Two drummers, a voice, a guitar, and a collection of sonic oddities collide to something strange and beautiful.
