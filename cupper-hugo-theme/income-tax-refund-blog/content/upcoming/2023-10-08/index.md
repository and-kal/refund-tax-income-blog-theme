**Omni Selassi**

Probably already in your heavy rotation since their last album dropped, 'cause you still can't quite fathom the weird appeal of Omni Selassi's wandering from inspirited dream sequences to no-waving meanderings to outerworldly exploration in harmony and riddims. If you believe the reviews of their audiences it's a strange and wholesome trip to participate in live.

**Space Schädel**

fka. Space Shuttle aka. the best school band around - making jazzy prog rock great again by means of fun soloings, hefty metal parts and well-crafted chaos. Recommended for fans of sports!
