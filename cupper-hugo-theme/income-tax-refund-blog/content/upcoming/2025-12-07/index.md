**Handle** [funk-post-punk <|> Bruxelles/Manchester]

Unexpected return of this fulminant trio that emerged from the Manchester mega group DUDS and partly merged into the Giulio Erasmus & The End of The Worm band
Jagging no-wave guitars, percussion-ladden post-punk riddims and other catchy noises and vocals, all of which will please a fan of contortions, talking heads and specials
After their grand debut on the great Upset The Rhythm label, let's see what new stuff they'll be spluttering

**Esil** [pop rap expérimental <|> Leipzig]

Solo project of this Maraudeur, The Staches, Double Job and EAZY member
Phat beats, sometimes evocative and celestial, sometimes fierce synths sounds, and polyglot singing make this a sweet trip
