**Jooklo Duo**
[chakric, mental no-jazz / Italy]

Was about time to bring the Jooklo experience to our little fair city. Roaming the improv and weird music underground already since the mid-00's, David Vanzan and Virginia Genta (also known through projects such as Golden Jooklo Age, Jooklo Quartet, Jooklo Stellar Tribe, Neokarma Jooklo Trio, New Jooklo Age etc.) will now play their first Leipzig show. Aham brahmƒÅsmi!


**Mik Quantus**
[incantational fungoid chants / Munich]

Mik is back in town! If you were smart, you caught him last year joining the keyboard/drumkit freakout duo *Talibam!*. Those old enough and with their memory not completely hazed, migt remember Mik as a member of kraut commune Embryo. Anyway, here's your chance to see Mik solo - bringing some of his custom throat-singing style and instrument-thrasing to the stage. Shree gum namah!
