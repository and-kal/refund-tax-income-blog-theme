**Ka Baird (RVNG Intl)**

"Ka Baird is a performer, composer, and sound designer based in New York City. They are known for their live solo performances which include extended vocal, breath and microphone techniques combined with electronics and psychoacoustic interplay of flutes and other woodwinds. They create a present tense sound with a vigorous delivery that seeks extreme release through physical exertion and psychic extension that "dances in the undefined margins of experimental sound, performance art, and humor."


**T.u.B. (Krut Records)**

Meditative noise weirdness by one of YOR's members.
