**milkweed** [post-irishfolk, UK]

Pour some cups of your preferred milk into a saucepan. Once the milk is warm, add your decarboxylated weed to... Oh, that was weedmilk. For milkweed, we'll need a banjo, a guitar, some warbling tapes and some old Irish folklore and blend it with some trippy beats into something nice and strange. If you don't have these ingredients at hand, just come to the show.

**Able Noise** [weird folk, NL]

And for some further freak folk and free sonic explorations stay tuned! There will be unfamiliar sounds, uncanny baritone guitar vibrations paired with pummeling drumming brought to you by George Knegtel, Alex Andropoulos and the physics of sound.
