**Asaf & Miho**

A soulful odyssey in which an array of wild audio crystalizes into pop songs only to be broken down again into chaos. Sampling producer Asaf Eden aka. Ryskinder and multi-instrumentalist Mi Ho met for the first time in 2018 while sharing the stage at a an infamous place called “Hühnermanhattan”. They discovered a shared passion for trance based improvisation and unfiltered expression. And so here's their return to HAL.
