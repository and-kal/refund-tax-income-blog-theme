**Fyodor Stepanov** (glitchscapes and broken transmissions, Leipzig)

...who's been visiting Pracht not too long ago as part of glitch A/V duo TraumaZone (alogside [Ksenia Bashmakova](http://kseniabashmakova.tilda.ws/)) is gonna present a brainy new solo set this time that consists of electromagnetic noise recordings and Markov chains (that is the cooler and more oldschool alternative to GenAI).
