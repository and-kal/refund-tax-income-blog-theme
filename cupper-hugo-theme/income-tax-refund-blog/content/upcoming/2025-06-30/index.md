[Alien Nosejob](https://aliennosejob.bandcamp.com/)
Initially a solo project by Australian musician Jake Robertson, it has grown into a full band known for its diverse sound and global performances. [IG](https://www.instagram.com/alien_nosejob)

[Mr. Strong](https://www.instagram.com/_mr._strong_)
Hailing from Galway and based in Leipzig, Mr. Strong merges Indie Rock & post-punk with noisy synths. The lyrics about lobotomies and hereditary trauma are infused with sarcastic Irish wit and Dadaist wordplay, turning modern absurdities into sharp, ironic hooks.

[Sa-Yuu](https://sayuu.bandcamp.com/)
Founded in Yokohama in 2010, with Hiroki Hanaike, who plays bass and drums simultaneously, and Kuwabara Miho on guitar and kazoo, both contributing vocals in Japanese. The name Sa Yuu, translating to "left and right," encapsulates their contrast of noise and pop, aggression and humor.

[Luke Kiid](https://www.mixcloud.com/DublinDigitalRadio/playlists/free-house-radio/) - DJ set
