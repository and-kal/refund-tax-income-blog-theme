**Vida Vojić** performs _Timing is Divine_ (drum'n'vox hypnosis/ SWE/GER)

»TIMING IS DIVINE« is a solo performance for voice and drums by Vida Vojić (also known as _vida voyage_), which fuses ancient Greek poetry with Swedish folk music, free jazz drumming and hypnotism to an equally playful and captivating act.

Vida Vojić also played in the lovely [TELEPATHS](https://telepathsss.bandcamp.com) lately, or you might know her from releases on PALE MASTER and First Terrace Records.
