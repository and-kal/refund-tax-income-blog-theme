**bunny hoova** ([Them There Records](https://themthere.bandcamp.com) / Manchester)

Hailing from the land of ill beats, bunny hoova is coming to Leipzig for the first time and is gonna have a salutary mix of lo-fi bedroom production soulfulness and nifty broken beat pop to share.

**TEll A ViSiON** ([Duchess Box Records](https://soundcloud.com/user-935381613) / Berlin)

We're super glad to have solo smart-pop artist TEll A ViSiON (aka. TAV fka. Tellavision) sharing the stage to dredge us with her new selection of mesmerizing pop pearls as can be heard her on her recent s/t album as well as already on her previous record »ADD LAND« (out on Bureau B, 2019). Just like bunny hoova, TEll A ViSiON is affiliated with UK label [Curl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0wOOHun0PoNLkzNvKA0yQ), which makes this night's double feature a perfect enlacement.
