ITR presents:

the grand BBG hangout w/

**RYAN DAVIS** (solo // Americana, f.f.o. Kurt Vile, David Berman etc.)

Happy to have Ryan Davis coming all the way from Louisville back to Leipzig for some folksy storytelling. You may have seen him previously with his band Tropical Trash, or listened to his other projects Equipment Pointed Ankh and Roadhouse. Or maybe not. But it's class A stuff. Much like with his band State Champion you're in for some sprawling songs about melancholy, love, loss and all kinds of passions - only this time it's just guitar, voice and some backing tracks.

**NED COLLETTE** (solo // avantgarde folk)

Non-idiomatic folk music, which may remind you a bit of David Thomas Broughton or Bill Callahan or the likes. Unique stuff. I mean, you'll also be able to see Ned sharing the big stage with Bonnie 'Prince' Billy in Autumn. But if you wanna be a lighthouse customer, come to our show.

**GREEDY VULTURES** (band // surf country rock)

Feat. members of Highway Patrol and Stalag, G.V. will bring a wistful sort of garage punk blues surf rock that sounds like a postcard with a sunset on a beach and a Harley.
