Vida Vojić performs Timing is Divine (drum&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;vox hypnosis/ SWE/GER)
»TIMING IS DIVINE« is a solo performance for voice and drums by Vida Vojić (also known as vida voyage), which fuses ancient Greek poetry with Swedish folk music, free jazz drumming and hypnotism to an equally playful and captivating act.
Vida Vojić also played in the lovely TELEPATHS lately, or you might know her from releases on PALE MASTER and First Terrace Records.</description></item></channel></rss>
