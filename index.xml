Luna Vega (Leipzig)
Luna Vega’s first studio efforts involved just a preset drum machine + Vermona organ, often nodding to 70s proto-electronic pioneers. The project has now evolved into a 3piece live band: repetitive drum machine patterns, multi-layered organs, wonky synths, 90&amp;rsquo;s psych guitars. Spaced-out nostalgia-powered grooves for the heads of the 2020&amp;rsquo;s.

Happy to have Ryan Davis coming all the way from Louisville back to Leipzig for some folksy storytelling. You may have seen him previously with his band Tropical Trash, or listened to his other projects Equipment Pointed Ankh and Roadhouse. Or maybe not. But it&amp;rsquo;s class A stuff. Much like with his band State Champion you&amp;rsquo;re in for some sprawling songs about melancholy, love, loss and all kinds of passions - only this time it&amp;rsquo;s just guitar, voice and some backing tracks.</description></item><item><title>Heavenphetamine + Luna Vega + Neuköllner Speed Dating Club</title><link>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2024-05-30/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 11:12:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2024-05-30/</guid><description>Income Tax Refund presents:

Heavenphetamine (Georgia/Ukraine)
Heavenphetamine is a Japanese krautrock/postpunk duo composed of Hiroki (keyboard/vocals) and Sara (drums/vocals), sometimes supported by flautist Kira Krempova. Described as a blend of Krautrock and Post-Punk, their musicality strongly reflects the influence of Western indie music. Simultaneously, the underlying Japanese melodies, beats, and Japanese lyrics contribute to crafting an exceptionally exotic sonic landscape.</description></item><item><title>AKENKALYPSE</title><link>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2024-05-03/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Mar 2024 11:12:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2024-05-03/</guid><description>i.t.r. doesn&amp;rsquo;t present, but recommends:

We&amp;rsquo;re stoked to have two acts from our much venerated music collective Salka coming to town once more. That&amp;rsquo;s the collective that already garlanded our shows with mind-expanding artists like the Kurws, the Przepych, the Atol Atol Atol or the Barłóg. This time our inner worlds will be perfused by Jakub Majchrzak (whom you know from the aforementioned Kurws or from Życia Żółć) and his befuddlingly ill-tempered guitar musings under the Strzał w kolano moniker.</description></item><item><title>game boy advance + Onisuka Tiger</title><link>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2024-04-29/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 11:12:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2024-04-29/</guid><description>i.t.r. &amp;amp; ?? present

Vomitatrix (space noise grind/NY,USA)
&amp;hellip;are Gyna Bootleg (vocals), Rick eye (guitar), Tim Dahl (bass guitar, vocals), Weasel Walter (drums). The band conjures up something you might call ACID-GRIND. It’s vaguely based on traditional hardcore/grindcore archetypes, but the result is explosive hallucinatory madness, uniquely alchemical to the four personalities which make up the band. The “songs” are inexplicable structures that take perhaps one tiny grain from the idiom and flesh them out into a vortex of bizarre energy and noise.</description></item><item><title>Datashock + Pretty Lightning + Javier Areal Velez</title><link>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2023-09-18/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 10:11:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2023-09-18/</guid><description>income tax refund presents

Clean, cool basslines intermingling with alarm-sound synths, springy guitars and zesty vocals.

Woodwind instruments fans listen up! Ka Baird is coming to our little aviary. Ka are a performer, composer, and sound designer from NYC. They&amp;rsquo;ve releases out on reliable labels such as RVNG Intl., FRKWYS, and Drag City, plus a whole bunch of psych-folk rite records with Spires That In The Sunset Rise group. As for solo live performances, Ka uses extended vocal, breath and microphone techniques that intermingle with atypical electronic and flutes sounds creating a strange world of sonic fun, improvised noise, strange movements.</description></item><item><title>Alpha Strategy, Forbidden Wizards, Tim Dahl + Thore Warland</title><link>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2022-09-30/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 14:38:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://itritritr.netlify.app/past/2022-09-30/</guid><description>Unfortunately TIPP + SPIELO had to cancel their show(s) but they&amp;rsquo;ll be back in Leipzig soon enough.
