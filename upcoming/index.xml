Was about time to bring the Jooklo experience to our little fair city. Roaming the improv and weird music underground already since the mid-00&amp;rsquo;s, David Vanzan and Virginia Genta (also known through projects such as Golden Jooklo Age, Jooklo Quartet, Jooklo Stellar Tribe, Neokarma Jooklo Trio, New Jooklo Age etc.) will now bring some chakric, mental no-jazz to Leipzig for the first time.

&amp;ldquo;Ka Baird is a performer, composer, and sound designer based in New York City. They are known for their live solo performances which include extended vocal, breath and microphone techniques combined with electronics and psychoacoustic interplay of flutes and other woodwinds. They create a present tense sound with a vigorous delivery that seeks extreme release through physical exertion and psychic extension that &amp;ldquo;dances in the undefined margins of experimental sound, performance art, and humor.</description></item></channel></rss>
