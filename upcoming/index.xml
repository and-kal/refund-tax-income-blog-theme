Luna Vega (Leipzig)
Luna Vega’s first studio efforts involved just a preset drum machine + Vermona organ, often nodding to 70s proto-electronic pioneers. The project has now evolved into a 3piece live band: repetitive drum machine patterns, multi-layered organs, wonky synths, 90&amp;rsquo;s psych guitars. Spaced-out nostalgia-powered grooves for the heads of the 2020&amp;rsquo;s.

Neuköllner Speed Dating Club (Leipzig)
&amp;hellip;started as a solo project based around samplers, drum machines, synthesizers and keyboards, but now performs with a constantly changing line-up of various instruments.</description></item><item><title>Lemongrab + Doc FLippers + Neon Lies</title><link>https://marvelous-crostata-5e7f99.netlify.app/upcoming/2024-06-18/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 11:12:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://marvelous-crostata-5e7f99.netlify.app/upcoming/2024-06-18/</guid><description>ITR presents:

the grand BBG hangout w/
RYAN DAVIS (solo // Americana, f.f.o. Kurt Vile, David Berman etc.)
Happy to have Ryan Davis coming all the way from Louisville back to Leipzig for some folksy storytelling. You may have seen him previously with his band Tropical Trash, or listened to his other projects Equipment Pointed Ankh and Roadhouse. Or maybe not. But it&amp;rsquo;s class A stuff. Much like with his band State Champion you&amp;rsquo;re in for some sprawling songs about melancholy, love, loss and all kinds of passions - only this time it&amp;rsquo;s just guitar, voice and some backing tracks.</description></item><item><title>Heavenphetamine + Luna Vega + Neuköllner Speed Dating Club</title><link>https://marvelous-crostata-5e7f99.netlify.app/upcoming/2024-05-30/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Apr 2024 11:12:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://marvelous-crostata-5e7f99.netlify.app/upcoming/2024-05-30/</guid><description>Income Tax Refund presents:
psych-pop / kraut / experimental evening in Leipzig Ost
THURSDAY, May 30th @ XonXanXop
| Doors: 19:30 |
| Start: 20:00 |
Heavenphetamine (Georgia/Ukraine)
Heavenphetamine is a Japanese krautrock/postpunk duo composed of Hiroki (keyboard/vocals) and Sara (drums/vocals), sometimes supported by flautist Kira Krempova. Described as a blend of Krautrock and Post-Punk, their musicality strongly reflects the influence of Western indie music. Simultaneously, the underlying Japanese melodies, beats, and Japanese lyrics contribute to crafting an exceptionally exotic sonic landscape.</description></item><item><title>Ulla Suspekt + Polster + Senthulà</title><link>https://marvelous-crostata-5e7f99.netlify.app/upcoming/2024-06-02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 11:12:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://marvelous-crostata-5e7f99.netlify.app/upcoming/2024-06-02/</guid><description>ITR presents:

Sentuhlà (ritualistic riddims / Valencia / Abstrakce Records)
»Sentuhlà is one of the many aliases of musical jack of all trades José Guerrero, a long standing figure in the already rich underground scene of Valencia. In this solo excursion he explores the vast possibilities of mechanical repetition, the machine funk of dirtbag rhythms and proper boogie DIY synth music, sculpting a syncopated sound that is both modern and atavistic.</description></item></channel></rss>
