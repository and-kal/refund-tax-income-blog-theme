the grand BBG hangout w/
RYAN DAVIS (solo // Americana, f.f.o. Kurt Vile, David Berman etc.)
Happy to have Ryan Davis coming all the way from Louisville back to Leipzig for some folksy storytelling. You may have seen him previously with his band Tropical Trash, or listened to his other projects Equipment Pointed Ankh and Roadhouse. Or maybe not. But it&amp;rsquo;s class A stuff. Much like with his band State Champion you&amp;rsquo;re in for some sprawling songs about melancholy, love, loss and all kinds of passions - only this time it&amp;rsquo;s just guitar, voice and some backing tracks.</description></item></channel></rss>
