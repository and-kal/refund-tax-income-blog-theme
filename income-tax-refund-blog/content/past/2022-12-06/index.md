**Ka Baird (RVNG Intl)**

Woodwind instruments fans listen up! [Ka Baird](https://www.kabaird.com/) is coming to our little aviary. Ka are a performer, composer, and sound designer from NYC. They've releases out on reliable labels such as RVNG Intl., FRKWYS, and Drag City, plus a whole bunch of psych-folk rite records with Spires That In The Sunset Rise group. As for solo live performances, Ka uses extended vocal, breath and microphone techniques that intermingle with atypical electronic and flutes sounds creating a strange world of sonic fun, improvised noise, strange movements.


**T.u.B. (Krut Records)**

"Traum und Bedeutung"? "Turnen und Bewegungsspiel"? "Tanz und Bildung"? No idea... But you're in for some meditative noise weirdness as emitted by one of [YOR](https://ubac.bandcamp.com/album/yor-the-future)'s members.
Come on, sit down tailor-fashion and get floored!


**Good Luck**
...from Hamburg's rds rec label will provide a bit of intermission music, especially selected from his vast collection of pretty, noisy and lo-fi waxes.


Please come tested~
